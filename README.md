# Cache Manifest Validator
![Project is unmaintained](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-unmaintained-red.svg?style=flat-square)

An Node.js based validator for cache manifest files

> ### Notice
> **Appcache has been marked as deprecated in browsers and will be removed soon, also from [the upcoming HTML spec](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2016May/0032.html). You can still use this project on your own, but the code and the website won't be maintained any longer.** Please use Service Worker instead, to make websites offline capable.
>
> ### Service Worker API
> Service Workers are providing a better programmatic interface for network requests and more granular control over handling offline resources.

## Installation

Using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), first get all required dependencies with `npm install`, then use `npm start` to start the application. Unit tests can be executed with `npm test`.


## API

The validation service can also be used by external tools. Either provide an URI to your manifest or the file's content as a string (GET and POST are supported). The API either returns a JSON or [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSONP), when you provide the optional callback parameter.
